# terminal-puzzle-thing
Idk I made a terminal based puzzle for anyone to solve. Basic riddles and ciphers, imma make it more difficult later. Did it just to finally use Java after never using it. 

You'll have to disagree with statement #1, and then yea. 

Also the answers have been encrypted in the code themselves so you can't find them out accidently. Ill make it actually difficult later if needed.
